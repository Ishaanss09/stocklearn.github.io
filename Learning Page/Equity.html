                <h4>What is an Equity Market?</h4>
                <p>An equity market is a market in which shares of companies are issued and traded, either through
                    exchanges
                    or over-the-counter markets. Also known as the stock market, it is one of the most vital areas of a
                    market economy. It gives companies access to capital to grow their business, and investors a piece
                    of
                    ownership in a company with the potential to realize gains in their investment based on the
                    company's
                    future performance. </p>
                <p>
                    Total equity capital of a company is divided into equal units of small
                    denominations, each called a share. For example, in a company the total equity capital of Rs
                    2,00,00,000
                    is divided into 20,00,000 units of Rs 10 each. Each such unit of Rs 10 is called a Share. Thus, the
                    company then is 11 said to have 20,00,000 equity shares of Rs 10 each. The holders of such shares
                    are
                    members of the company and have voting rights.

        <h3>1.Technical analysis :</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading
                opportunities by analysing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and
                volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a security's value based on business
                results such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on the study of price and volume.

        <h3>2.Fundamental analysis :</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Fundamental analysis (FA) is a method of measuring a security's intrinsic value by examining related
                economic and financial factors. Fundamental analystsâ€™ study anything that can affect the security's
                value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to
                microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management.
                The end goal is to arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in
                order to see whether the security is undervalued or overvalued.
                This method of stock analysis is considered to be in contrast to technical analysis, which forecasts the
                direction of prices through an analysis of historical market data such as price and volume.

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Intraday means "within the day." In the financial world, the term is shorthand used to describe
                securities that trade on the markets during regular business hours. These securities include stocks and
                exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Intraday also signifies the highs and lows that the asset crossed
                throughout the day. Intraday price movements are particularly significant to short-term or day traders
                looking to make multiple trades over the course of a single trading session. These busy traders will
                settle all their positions when the market closes.

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                Short-term investments, also known as marketable securities or temporary investments, are financial
                investments that can easily be converted to cash, typically within 5 years. Many short-term investments
                are sold or converted to cash after a period of only 3-12 months. Some common examples of short-term
                investments include CDs, money market accounts, high-yield savings accounts, government bonds, and
                Treasury bills. Usually, these investments are high-quality and highly liquid assets or investment
                vehicles.

        <h3>5.Long term :</h3>
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                "Long term" refers to the extended period of time that an asset is held. Depending on the type of
                security, a long-term asset can be held for as little as one year or for as long as 30 years or more.
                Generally speaking, long-term investing for individuals is often thought to be in the range of at least
                seven to 10 years of holding time, although there is no absolute rule.
